                <h1 style="color: #1e90ff;">What Things To Keep In Mind When Choosing a Theme</h1>
                <p>When it comes to choosing a theme for their websites, most newcomers are overwhelmed. There are
                    thousands of themes available, both free and paid. Each theme appears to be superior to the others.
                    How do you pick the best WordPress theme?<br><br>As a result, I've compiled a list of 7 Things to
                    Consider When Choosing a Theme.</p>
                <h4>1. DO choose a theme that supports the latest version of WordPress:</h4>
                <p>
                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>My #1 recommendation has nothing to do with layout or fonts—all it's about is usefulness and
                    security. For three very good reasons, the theme you pick must be compatible with the most recent
                    version of WordPress:</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:list -->
                <ul>
                    <li>If your theme isn't entirely compatible with the current WP version, your WordPress site's
                        functionality may not operate as you want.</li>
                    <li>If the plugins you use on your site require the most recent version of WordPress and you are
                        unable to upgrade due to your theme, your site's functionality will suffer.</li>
                    <li>If you pick a theme that does not support newer versions of WordPress, you may decide to stop
                        upgrading WordPress, which can lead to security flaws, data breaches, site defacement, and other
                        undesirable outcomes.</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- /wp:list -->
                </p>
                <h4>2. Strive for Simplicity:</h4>
                <p>Many WordPress themes have a variety of colors, complex layouts, spectacular animations, and so on.
                    You may require those items on occasion, but in most circumstances, you will not require all of
                    them. Look for a theme with a design layout that will assist you to achieve your aim. It must look
                    excellent without sacrificing usefulness or simplicity.<br><br> Make certain that the presentation style
                    of the theme is not excessively complex. The goal of web design is to help users discover the
                    information they need while also supporting site owners in achieving their objectives.</p>
                <h4>3.  Responsive is Not Optional Anymore:</h4>
                <p>
                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Responsive themes automatically alter their layout to fit multiple screen sizes and devices.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Mobile and other handheld devices produce a large amount of online traffic. Depending on the content
                    of your website, this figure might be as high as 50% of the total number of visitors.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Most WordPress themes are already responsive by default. But there are still sellers who are selling
                    fixed-width layouts that are not mobile-friendly at all. Make sure that the theme you are choosing
                    for your website is mobile-friendly.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
                </p>
                <h4>4. Supported Plugins:</h4>
                <p>If you are looking for a WordPress theme, you should also consider its compatibility with plugins
                    because WordPress plugins are what give WordPress its true power. You can accomplish anything with
                    your WordPress site thanks to these plugins.</p>
                <h4>5. Page Builders:</h4>
                <p>
                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Page builders are WordPress plugins that let you construct page layouts with a drag-and-drop user
                    interface.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p> Many premium WordPress themes have pre-installed page builders. Some of these page builders are
                    only available to the theme creator.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Using a page builder like this to construct landing pages might result in a lot of needless code. If
                    you ever change the theme, those pages will need a lot of cleaning up.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>You should select themes that have one of the most popular page builder plugins. You may also buy
                    these page builders individually and use them with different themes.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
                </p>
                <h4>6. SEO Friendliness:</h4>
                <p>
                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Your theme is critical to the SEO friendliness of your site. A good-looking theme might also produce
                    poorly coded HTML, which can harm your site's search engine performance.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>It may be tough for beginners to evaluate the source code of a theme on their own. This is why many
                    premium theme developers will tell you that their sites are SEO-friendly.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
                </p>
                <h4>7. Ratings and Reviews:</h4>
                <p>
                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>The ratings and reviews left by users are other good measures of a theme's quality. Customer reviews
                    will appear if the theme is offered on a third-party marketplace.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>The rating area for free themes is located directly below the download button. It will display the
                    number of user reviews and ratings. If you click on 5 stars, it will display all of the reviewers
                    that rated the theme 5 stars.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
                </p>

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Most individuals desire to improve their time management skills, and it's no secret that technology
                    can help them do so. However, it is the same technology that led us to waste our time, such as
                    social media and frequent emails, so here are some time-saving ideas and hacks.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><strong>1. Plan ahead</strong>:</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Make sure you begin each day with a clear understanding of what you need to do - what must be
                    completed THAT DAY. Consider making it a habit to write out your "to-do" list for the next weekday
                    at the conclusion of each workday. That way, you'll be ready to go the next morning.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><strong>2. Create a schedule:</strong></p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>The first step in developing an efficient plan is to make a list of your preferred ways to spend your
                    time. So, you'll have a goal to work toward with your time management, and you'll be able to create
                    a timetable using tools like Google Calendar.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><strong>3. Create tasks and reminders for all of your tasks:</strong></p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>I propose creating tasks and assigning them a due date, so you know what to accomplish and when to
                    complete it. Knowing your deadlines and setting reminders are also essential for effective time
                    management. We recommend setting a reminder 15 minutes before a meeting or event to provide time to
                    prepare and the app that I recommend is Microsoft To-Do: Lists &amp; Tasks.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><strong>4. Prioritize important tasks</strong>:</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Tasks can be grouped into 4 categories:</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:list -->
                <ul id="block-00f83ac0-4f95-49f3-9c9f-367e01366188">
                    <li>urgent and important</li>
                    <li>not urgent but important</li>
                    <li>urgent but not important</li>
                    <li>neither urgent nor important</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- /wp:list -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>People who manage their time well prioritize "urgent and important" and "not urgent but important,"
                    while ignoring "urgent but not important" and "neither urgent nor important."</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><strong>5. Look at the technology you use to waste time:</strong></p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Your schedule will not be fixed if you continue to use social networking applications and other
                    time-wasting technologies, so get rid of them. I propose that you use applications to track how much
                    time you spend on each app so that you can see where you are spending your time.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><strong>6. Make use of the Pomodoro method:</strong></p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management approach that encourages individuals to work with, rather
                    than against, the time they have. You divide your workday into 25-minute pieces interrupted by
                    five-minute intervals using this strategy. These intervals are known as Pomodoro. And the major
                    purpose for taking 5-minute breaks is to allow your mind to relax, which enhances productivity.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><strong>7. Organize Yourself:</strong></p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Do you spend a lot of time searching for files on your computer? Make time to set up a file
                    management system.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p> Is your filing system causing you problems? Reorganize it so that you can find what you're looking
                    for fast.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><strong>8. The 4 Ds of Time Management</strong>:</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>The 4 Ds of time management, often known as the 4 Ds of productivity, are a popular technique for
                    determining whether work or project is worthwhile. It helps make a rapid choice on what to do
                    immediately, either by doing it yourself or delegating to someone else, what to do later, or what to
                    remove from your to-do list.</p>
